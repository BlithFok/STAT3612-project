# STAT3612-project
This is a repository for HKU STAT3612 project. <br/>
In this project, we will utilize various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict hospital readmission. The primary coding language is Python. <br/> <br/>

Our modelling is mainly divided as follows: <br/>
Model 1: EHR Data Modeling <br/>
Model 2: Chest Radiographs Modeling <br/>
Model 3: Clinical Notes Modeling <br/>
Final model: Multimodal Model <br/>
<br/>
In each model, we will experiment different algroithms and evaluate the performance. Then pick the model with best performance into our fusion model. <br/>
Project deadline: 9 May 2025
